# Sprites Knowledge Base for Dragon Fight Assets

This document provides a structured, LLM-parseable overview of the assets in `assets/Sprites/` (adapted from Streets of Fight files for Dragon Fight). Format: Markdown with YAML-style sections for easy extraction (e.g., by AI for code gen). All under CC0â€”free for mod/commercial use. Dimensions approx (scale to 47px height for consistency). Animations: Individual PNG frames in subdirectories; frame_count from actual files.

## Parsing Notes for LLM
- Extract sections as YAML for code generation.
- Usage: Map animation names to indices (e.g., player.currentAnimIndex = 3 for Jab).
- Mods: Assets are PNG frames; source .ase files may be elsewhere.
- Total: All PNGs in Sprites/ covered: Brawler-Girl (39 frames), Enemy-Punk (15 frames), shadow.png (1).
- Sources: Direct from folder structure and file enumeration.
